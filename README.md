# Biological Sequence Alignments
## A ICOM 4038 Project


### Overview
This is the first project of the course `Análisis y Diseño de Algoritmos` (Analysis and Design of Algorithms in spanish) during the 2022 spring semester.

Students had to learn basic Bioinformatics to implement the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm. For this students watched [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2Y2g0rfLPM) video that explains in detail the algorithm. It's in spanish btw. Students also watch [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SU22pycFrDk) other video to further understand basic Bioinformatics. The latter video is part of the Introduction to Bioinformatics course (BIMM-143).
